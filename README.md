# Collection of Quick Visualizations written in Processing

Below are some scripts I wrote for various purposes. It originally started with a stinger for videos, but I figured I would put other small sketches here as well to not just have a bunch of repositories.

# someStuffVisualizer
 An outro in Processing with shapes orbiting and changing in a circle

The only reason I am making a repo for this one is that I might keep continuously adding to it, making different additions that I can port to other projects like:

- utilization of GUI
- having a better understanding of classes and not tanking the whole project if I mess something up
- and synthesized sound maybe!
